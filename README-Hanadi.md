## Budget tracking software
#### Overview: A program in Python that tracks budget, as a user, I should be able to input expenses and then view the highest, lowest, and total expenses, in addition to the average expense.

In this project, I used the following requirements:
- 3 different data types (int, float, and string )
- Use list and dictionary.
- Use loops.
- Use functions that return output.
- Use conditions.
- Use a Lambda function.
